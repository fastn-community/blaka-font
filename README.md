# Blaka: fastn Font Package

This repository contains a [fastn font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Blaka](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Blaka/about).

Blaka is an experimental typeface, enriching the gothic feeling of Black Letters
by enhancing the geometric features to create midgrounds with the Kufic style
for the Arabic letterforms.

The aesthetical matching process between the two scripts relies on the features
of being hand-drawn with a reed pen. While Latin letterforms maintain sharp
edges, Arabic relies on sharp edges and thick strokes to create overlaps to
replace a usual baseline in most letterforms, giving the Arabic letterforms
contemporary features.

Designers: Mohamed Gaber, Principal design
